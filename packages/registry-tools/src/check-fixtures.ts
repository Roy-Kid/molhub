/**
 * Prove the gate can fail.
 *
 *     npm run registry:test
 *
 * `test/fixtures/` holds complete, registry-shaped directories, each broken in
 * exactly one way. This runs `src/validate.ts` — the real program,
 * as a real process, so the exit code is proven and not just the message — once
 * per fixture, and asserts two things:
 *
 *   1. every broken registry is rejected, **for the reason it was written to
 *      test**. Merely checking that it was rejected would pass even if every
 *      fixture failed for the same unrelated reason;
 *   2. `good/` is accepted, so a fixture failing because of a bug in the
 *      validator shows up as `good/` failing too rather than as a false sense
 *      of coverage.
 *
 * A gate nobody has watched fail is not a gate. When a rule is added to
 * `ManifestValidator` or `lib/validator.ts`, a fixture is added here in the same
 * change: a rule without a fixture has never been proven to fire.
