"""Local cache for fetched artifact files.

Files are filed under the key the caller names them by — in practice a
coordinate plus a role, e.g. ``dataset/molcrafts/qm9@v2/main``. That is what a
manifest already identifies, so no digest is needed to address the cache and
none has to be invented when a platform publishes none.

    $MOLHUB_HOME/                default ~/.cache/molhub
      files/<key>/<...>          fetched artifacts, keyed by coordinate + role
      tmp/                       in-flight transfers, same filesystem

The layout is a shared contract: the TypeScript client uses the same directory
so two clients on one machine share downloads.
