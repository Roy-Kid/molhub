"""Fetcher — ordered fallback across locators, with an optional published-digest check.

What this class guarantees, always: **a path it returns holds a complete file
that the server returned with a 200.** Truncated and error responses never
reach it — that comes from the transport contract in
:mod:`molhub.sources.drivers.https`, not from any digest.

When the caller supplies a digest, it is additionally checked. A digest here is
the platform's own published value, and the question it answers is "does
upstream still serve the version this manifest names?". A mismatch means
upstream changed and the manifest needs updating, so the fetcher stops using
that mirror rather than retrying it. Platforms that publish nothing simply get
no check.
