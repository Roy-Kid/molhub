"""Manifest — the record that says where an artifact's bytes actually are.

A manifest is data, not code. Adding a dataset to molhub is a YAML file in the
registry, not a Python module and not a release. That is the whole reason this
layer exists.

Parsing is typed and strict rather than schema-driven at runtime: the shipped
``schema/manifest.schema.yaml`` is the language-neutral contract for the registry
CI and for non-Python clients, while this module produces precise, actionable
errors without dragging a validator into every install.

A manifest names **one version** of an artifact, and the thing that makes that
precise is the **locator**, which must pin a version upstream understands:
a Zenodo record id, a Figshare article *plus* its version number, a HuggingFace
commit. Persistent identifiers do this job already — that is what they are for
— so a manifest records the ``doi`` and pins the locator, and does not need to
invent an identity of its own.

Getting this wrong is quiet. ``figshare://1057646`` resolves to whatever is
current, so a manifest written against v2 starts serving v3 the day upstream
publishes one, with nothing to indicate it.

``digest`` is optional and secondary: whatever the platform publishes for the
file, copied verbatim (Figshare and Zenodo publish md5, HuggingFace a sha256
LFS OID). It catches a platform breaking its own immutability promise. molhub
never invents one — a number computed from its own download attests only to
that download, and requiring it would mean fetching an entire artifact just to
write a registry entry.

``size`` is optional in the same way, but **not both at once**: an artifact
must record a ``digest``, a ``size``, or both, or a completed transfer has
nothing whatsoever to be checked against. Requiring one of the two keeps
cataloguing cheap — a size comes from a HEAD request's content-length, which
hauls no bytes — while requiring a digest outright would not.

Corrupt and truncated transfers are caught by the transport contract in
:mod:`molhub.sources` (status check, temp file, atomic rename), which depends
on none of this.
