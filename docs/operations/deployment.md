# Deployment

Use Node 22 and run all commands from the MolHub repository root.

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run dev --workspace @molcrafts/molhub-web
npm run db:migrate:local --workspace @molcrafts/molhub-api
npm run dev --workspace @molcrafts/molhub-api
uv run pytest
```

## Web

Build against a validated canonical registry snapshot, set `PUBLIC_MOLHUB_API_URL` and
`PUBLIC_MOLHUB_REGISTRY_REVISION`, then deploy the immutable `apps/web/dist/client` directory. Smoke
`/molhub/`, Explore, one detail page, Submit, and the 3BPA Inspector route. The footer must show the
registry source revision used for the build.

## Submission API

Create D1 and replace the `wrangler.jsonc` placeholder database id. Store `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`,
and `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with Wrangler secrets. Apply migrations locally first, then remotely; run
Worker tests and `deploy:dry` before deployment. Smoke `/health`, create, and status in staging.

The initial database definition describes the current pre-1.0 structure. No historical upgrade path is
maintained. Interrupted publication can be retried from the Reviewing or All queue.

Rollback the Worker with Cloudflare deployment rollback and redeploy the previous immutable Web build.
Rotate a secret by writing the replacement, updating the matching GitHub webhook/client, testing, then
revoking the old credential. Never put secrets in repository variables or `.dev.vars` commits.
